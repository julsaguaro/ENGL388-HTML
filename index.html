  <h1>Hello, English 388</h1>
  <p>Hello everyone! I'm Julia and I am a senior here at the UW majoring in accounting and English. I have been very busy the past few years but when I have free time I like to take walks, collect stationery, and use my plane tracker app. I will be graduating from the UW in about two months now and am excited for the next chapter. Go Dawgs!</p>
